## Overview

***M***ETA is a JavaScript-based project that simplifies and optimizes the configuration of the ***M***ulti-function network tool â€” a cross-platform, rule-based utility for managing network and application traffic. It provides extensive support for advanced features and custom configurations.

So, what exactly does the Multi-functional network tool refer to? Well, if you are asking this question, this project may not be for you because you probably donâ€™t need the Multi-function network tool at all.

## Key Features

- **Powerful Icon Support**: Imports two icon sets to visually represent all proxy groups, and provides favicon extraction capabilities.
- **Flexible Service Configuration**: Easily add, remove, or modify services, including custom names and icons.
- **Precise Location Filters**: Use country-specific filters to cluster each proxy into a corresponding location proxy group with a custom icon, so that other proxy groups contain only the lowest latency proxies as representatives for that location to choose from.
- **Advanced DNS Management**:
  - Supports Chinese and international nameservers.
  - Configurable DNS settings including fake IP, filtering, and custom policies.
- **Proxy Group Management**:
  - Various proxy group types (e.g., Auto, Fallback, Load Balancing).
  - Automatic grouping for custom services and locations.
- **Intelligent Routing Rules**:
  - Rule-based routing for diverse services and applications.
  - Integration with our carefully crafted [Rulesets in MRS Format](https://github.com/Project-META/rules-mrs) and the official MRS formatted rulesets of the Multi-function network tool.
- **Seamless Rule Provider Integration**: Set up and maintain rule providers automatically with regular updates.
- **Extensible Architecture**: Add new services, locations, or modify existing configurations easily.
- **Performance Optimization**: Includes lazy loading, configurable health checks, and optimized rule updates.
- **Customizable TUN Mode**: Configure TUN mode for improved compatibility and performance.
- **Privacy and Ad-Blocking**: Integrated rules for blocking ads and trackers.
- **Automatic Updates**: Enable auto-updates for GeoIP and GeoSite data.
- **Compatibility**: Supports the Multi-functional network tool clients, enhancing normal configurations.

## Usage Guide

Follow these steps to use META:

### 1. Prepare Base Configuration

Start with a valid configuration file of the Multi-function network tool containing at least one proxy or proxy provider, typically generated by importing a subscription URL into your client.

### 2. Import META Script

- **For M.P.**:
  1. Go to "Override" in the sidebar.
  2. Import the META script via one of the accessible URLs above.
  3. Click the three dots on the script's card, click "Edit File", edit and save the script, if needed.
  
- **For C.V.**:
  1. Navigate to the "Profiles" page.
  2. Visit one of the above URLs, select all, and copy to get the current META script content.
  3. Add META script content to the editor opened by double-clicking the "Global Extend Script" card.
  4. Edit before saving if needed.

### 3. Apply and Update Configuration

- For M.P., click the three dots on the script's card, click "Edit Info", turn on the "Globally Enabled" option, and save.
- For C.V., click "Reactivate Profiles" button in the upper right side of the window.

### 4. Verify the Configuration

Check the client's "Execution Log" or "Script Console" to ensure that the META script executed successfully to generate the new configuration:

- If your base configuration is correct, it will output the number of identified proxies and proxy providers, and the generated configuration in JSON format.
- If there are errors, correct your basic configuration according to the error and the URL in the output.

For other clients, please refer to the official documentation of the corresponding clients.

## Customization Guide

META is highly customizable. Below are some key areas you can modify:

### 1. **Icon Set URL**

Change the `BASE_ICON_SET_URL` or `LOCATION_ICON_SET_URL` constants to use a different icon set.

### 2. **Services**

Modify the `services` array to add or remove services:

- `name`: Service name.
- `icon`: URL of the service icon.
- `alias`: Must be set to the rule set file name when inconsistent with the name.

### 3. **Locations**

Customize the `locations` array to define geographical locations:

- `name`: Location name.
- `icon`: URL of the location icon.
- `filter`: Regex pattern for matching.

### 4. **General Configuration**

Adjust `generalConfig` object, for example:

- `allow-lan`: Set to `true` for LAN access.
- `log-level`: Set logging level (`silent`, `error`, `warning`, `info`, `debug`).
- `ipv6`: Enable/disable IPv6 support.

### 5. **DNS**

Modify the `dns` object to change nameservers and DNS policies.

### 6. **Hosts**

Add custom hosts in the `hosts` object.

### 7. **Domain Sniffing**

Enable and configure domain sniffing in the `sniffer` object.

### 8. **TUN**

Customize TUN settings in the `tun` object.

### 9. **Proxy Groups (be cautious)**

Customize the `proxyGroups` array to set proxy strategy according to actual needs.

### 10. **Routing Rules (be cautious)**

Customize the `rules` array for traffic management.

### 11. **Rule Providers (be cautious)**

Add custom rule providers in the `ruleProviders` object.

It is strongly recommended to refer to the official documentation of the Multi-function network tool when customizing META scripts, especially the areas marked "be cautious".
